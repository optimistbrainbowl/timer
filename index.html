			<h1>Timer</h1>
			<p>	This timer is a simple web application for timing questions for Optimist Brain Bowl (forked from a timer from Colorado Knowledge Bowl).</p>
			<a href="timer"><p><img src="KBTimer/KBTimerIcon256.png" alt="Timer" id="KBTimerIcon" /><span style="font-size: 150%; padding-left: 0.25em;">Open Now</span></p></a>
			<p>Features and instructions (including phone and tablet installation):
				<ul>
					<li>The timer starts at 15 seconds.</li>
					<li>Tap the screen to start the countdown.</li>
					<li>Tap again to reset to 15 seconds.</li>
					<li>Works even without an internet connection.</li>
					<li>Can provide a spoken 5-second warning and call "time" when time is up (which is useful for running practice, but should probably not be used during tournaments).</li>
					<li>The lower left has a continually counting clock as a backup for manual counting of time.</li>
					<li>Tap the button in the lower right to jump to 5 seconds remaining.</li>
					<li>Tap the button in the upper left to access the settings</li>
					<li>Available settings:
						<ul>
							<li>Whether or not to speak the five second warning and time expiration</li>
							<li>Which voice to use (available voices are device dependent)</li>
							<li>How fast to speak</li>
							<li>How many seconds to provide in the countdown (default 15)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li> Installation instructions:
						<ul>
							<li>Can be installed as an icon on the home screen of a phone or tablet. <i>(Make sure to set your screen auto-lock delay to be long enough so that you don't end up with a black screen in the middle of practice or a round!)</i></li>
							<li>Android: Open in Chrome. Tap the three dots in the upper right of the browser and select "Add to Home screen."</li>
							<li>iOS: Open in Safari.  In the browser controls, tap the icon that's a square with an arrow coming up out of it.  Scroll over and select "Add to Home Screen."</li>
						</ul>
